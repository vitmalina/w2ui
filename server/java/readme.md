This example is an eclipse project; due to eclipse restrictions it does not include the w2ui.js of the repository
but i get the latest version from http:://w2ui.com/

The package org.json is taken from http://json.org/java/

To make your own Servlet for grid management derive it from com.w2ui.servlet.W2uiGridData
