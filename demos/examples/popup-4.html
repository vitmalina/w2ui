		<h1>Based on Markup</h1>
		You can load popup completely from a markup. It will read title, body, buttons, as well as width and height of the new
		popup content. See example below how it works. The div that contains markup should have style="display: none", so it would not
		be visible on the page, if you include it into the same page.
		<div style="height: 10px"></div>
		Use <i>rel=title, rel=body, rel=buttons</i> to defined popup parts and <i>style="width: XXpx; height: XXpx; overflow: AA;"</i> 
		of the initial div to define size and overflow.
		outside of the popup will close it.
