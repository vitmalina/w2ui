## W2UI 1.1 - MIT License

W2UI is modern, intuitive JavaScript UI library for buidling rich data-driven web application. The library has
a small footprint and no dependencies except jQuery. The library has the following widgets:

* w2layout
* w2grid
* w2toolbar
* w2sidebar
* w2tabs
* w2form
* w2popup
* w2utils

## Quick Start

To start using the library you need to download w2ui-1.1.js (or w2ui-1.1.min.js) and w2ui-1.1.css files. All the widgets and their 
css classes are defined inside of these two files.

There is no requirement for a server side language. Java, PHP, ASP, Perl or .NET all will work, as long as you can return JSON
format from the server (or write a converter into JSON format).
