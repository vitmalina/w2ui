## W2UI 1.3 - MIT License

W2UI is modern, intuitive JavaScript UI library for building rich data-driven web application. The library has
a small footprint and no dependencies except jQuery. The library has the following widgets:

* w2layout
* w2grid
* w2toolbar
* w2sidebar
* w2tabs
* w2form
* w2popup
* w2utils

The complete library is only **56Kb** (minified & gzipped)


## Who Uses It

If you're using w2ui I'd love to hear about it and will be compiling a list of projects that use it. Please email me at vitmalina@gmail.com and
if you can included name of you company (or project) and a link (if it is on a public website), that would be fantastic.

## Quick Start

Current stable version is 1.3. 

You can:
- Download from here: [http://w2ui.com](http://w2ui.com) 
- Install using bower

```
bower install w2ui
```

To start using the library you need to include into your page: 

- w2ui-1.3.js (or w2ui-1.3.min.js) 
- w2ui-1.3.css (or w2ui-1.3.min.css) 

All the widgets and their css classes are defined inside of these two files. There is no image dependencies, some images
are embedded into CSS file.

There is no requirement for a server side language. Node, Java, PHP, ASP, Perl or .NET all will work, as long as you can 
return JSON format from the server (or write a converter into JSON format on the client).

## Documentation & Demos

You can find documentation and demos here:

## Bug Tracking

Have a bug or a feature request? Please open an issue here [https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues](https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues). 
Please make sure that the same issue was not previously submitted by someone else.


## Building

I use ANT to build the project. It does the following

- Compiles LESS files
- Concatenates and minifies CSS files
- Concatenates and minifies JS files 

In order to be able to use ANT, you will need to install Node.JS and NPM on your machine, then run the following command to install dependencies

```
sudo npm install less -g
sudo npm install clean-css -g
sudo npm install uglify-js@1 -g
```


## File Structure

```
- dist 			- compiled JS files, plus compiled CSS files 
- src 			- source JS files
  - kickstart 		- copy of another project used with the demos (not part of w2ui itself)
  - less 		- LESS files (source for css)
- demos 		- all demos, same as on the website
- libs			- auxilary libraries (jquery, codemirror, etc.) used in the demos (not part of w2ui itself)
- server		- example implementations for a server implementation communicating with w2ui instances
- test 			- feature testing files
```


## Other Build Tools

You can use other tools to build. Grunt seems to be promissing, and will do everything you need. You still need to install same dependencies
if you want to use grunt.


## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome. However, few things you need to know before contribution:

1. Please check out latest code before changing anything. It is harder to merge if your changes will not merge clean.
2. If you are changing JS files - do all changes in /src folder
3. If you are changing CSS files - do all changes in LESS in /src/less/src
4. If you want to help with unit test - do all changes in /test/qunit
5. If you want to change documenation - do all changes in /docs
6. If you want to add demos - do all changes in /demos
