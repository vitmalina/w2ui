<h4>Description</h4>

Internally, all w2ui widgets call trigger to execute event listeners. You can add your own events and trigger them with the
trigger function. The trigger function should be called twice. First time before the default behaviour is processed and the
second time after it it processed. This is needed to accomplish the functionality provided by the event flow.
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

Here is an example how widgets trigger events:
<textarea class="javascript">
// event before
var event = this.trigger({ phase: 'before', target: this.name, type: 'click', recid: recid, event: event });
if (event.cancelled === true) return false;

// default action

// event after
this.trigger($.extend(event, { phase: 'after' }));
</textarea>

As you see from the example above, the default action can be cancelled by event handler calling 
<span class="argument">event.preventDefault()</span>. There is no need to return <span class="argument">event</span> 
object because JavaScript passes objects by reference and changing the 
<span class="argument">event</span> within the handler will change the original object.
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

You can also define <span class="argument">event.onComplete</span> as
a call back when the default actions of the event are completed if you need to do some actions after event has
been processed.
