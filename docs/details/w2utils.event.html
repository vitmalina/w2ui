An object to work with custom events.

<div class="definition">
    Object
</div>

This object is used internally to provide event functionality for all widgets. You can apply it to your custom widgets in the
following way.

<textarea class="javascript">
	$.extend(yourObject, w2utils.event);
</textarea>

This will add to your object following functions:
<ul>
	<li>on(event, handler)</li>
	<li>off(event, [handler])</li>
	<li>trigger(eventData)</li>
</ul>

That you can use it to add event listeners and trigger events. See <a href="utils/events" class="method">Events</a> for additional information.
