There is a number of default settings used across w2ui library. The setting object is a map with the following structure:


<textarea class="javascript">
settings : {
    locale            : "en-us",
    dateFormat        : "mm/dd/yyyy",
    timeFormat        : "hh:mi pm",
    currencyPrefix    : "$",
    currencySuffix    : "",
    currencyPrecision : 2,
    groupSymbol       : ",",
    decimalSymbol     : ".",
    shortmonths       : ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"],
    fullmonths        : ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August",
                         "September", "October", "November", "December"],
    shortdays         : ["M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S","S"],
    fulldays          : ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
    weekStarts        : "M",        // can be "M" for Monday or "S" for Sunday
    dataType          : 'HTTPJSON', // can be HTTP, HTTPJSON, RESTFULL, RESTFULLJSON, JSON
    phrases           : {}          // empty object for phrases
    dateStartYear     : 1950,       // start year for date-picker
    dateEndYear       : 2020        // end year for date picker
}
</textarea>

<h4>Data Types</h4>

The dataType setting has 5 possible options. Below is explanation what they mean:
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

HTTP - will submit GET or POST where it makes more sense by the size of the data submitted in w2grid, w2form and in autocomplete field (enum and list)
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

HTTPJSON - is the default one and will submit GET or POST, similar to HTTP, but will submit all params as JSON string
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

RESTFULL - will fully comply with REST standard and will submit GET or POST or PUT or DELETE actions where needed. Note that often PUT and DELETE are disabled by various hosting services.

RESTFULLJSON - will fully comply with REST standard and will submit GET or POST or PUT or DELETE actions where needed. Note that often PUT and DELETE are disabled by various hosting services. But will submit all params as JSON payload
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

JSON - will submit all variables as JSON payload (not HTTP POST). On the server it needs to be parse differently.
