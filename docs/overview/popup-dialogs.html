<h3>Dialogs</h3>
Two most frequntly used dialogs are alert and cofirm. In the case of a alert you just need to display a message to the user and require no feedback
besides user acknowledgement. Confirm dialog has similar purpose, but expects from the user a response by accepting or declining to the request.
The w2ui library includes these dialogs for your convenience.

<h4>Alert</h4>

The alert dialog can be called in the following way:

<textarea class="javascript">
w2alert('This is an alert');
</textarea>

The method takes one or two arguments <span class="method">w2alert(msg, [title], [callBack])</span>, where msg is the message to display. You
can optionally supply title for the message. If you need to define more options, you can use <span class="method">$().w2popup()</span>.

<h4>Confirm</h4>

The confirm dialog can be called in the following way: 

<textarea class="javascript">
w2confirm('Are you sure?', function btn(answer) { alert(answer); })
</textarea>

The method takes up to three arguments <span class="method">w2confirm(msg, [title], [callBack])</span>, where msg is the message to display.
You can optionally supply title for the message and a call back function.
